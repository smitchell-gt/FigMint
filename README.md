FigMint
=======
FigMint is an iOS application I developed for HackGT, a hackathon at Georgia Tech where we had 36 hours to create a product from start to finish.

FigMint is a flashcard application that aims to solve two problems I have had with existing flashcard applications: 1) that they usually require you to dedicate x amount of time per week in order to get the most out of the application, and 2) that flashcard creation within the app is almost always tedious, moreso than it is to just make paper flashcards.

Currently, FigMint aims to solve the first problem by forcing a user to solve just 3 flashcards each time they open the app. When they finish the 3 cards, they may either load 3 more cards or go to the main menu. I thought this would be a good system of giving users an easily digestible chunk to study while waiting in line, walking to class, or bored on the bus. I have also implemeted a basic Leitner system for spaced repition, though this feature has not been thoroughly tested.

Figmint tackles the problem of flashcard creation by integrating the phone's hardware (camera, microphone) so that users can take pictures or record audio directly into their flashcards. The audio has not yet been implementing, but the camera function should be working.

Eventually, I would like to add the option for FigMint to place flashcards on or immediately after the unlock screen, so that users would have to complete one or two cards every time they unlock their phone. I would also like to add a couple of social features to the app, allowing users to have "study buddies" that they can set goals and challenges with each other.

This app is still very much a work in progress, but I am hoping to have a version ready to be submitted to the app store in a couple of months.
